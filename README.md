# Disneyclone Coding Challenge Day 5
A responsive vanilla css &amp; html clone of the disney.com landing page - Flexbox

This is the my coding project for the fifth day of my coding challenge. I've coded a clone of the Disney.com landing page, using vanilla css and html. You can clone this respostitory and follow along my youtube-tutorial to code and learn with me. This project focuses heavily on flexbox, because it is what I'm learning at course curriculum at scrimba.com.

--About me--

Hello! 
My name is Sebastian, and I'm a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since Christmas brake finally arrived, I've decided to start a challenge for myself! I'm going to code for the coming 20 days.

I'm following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I'm currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch)

By the end of the 20 days I'm hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself on my Youtube-channel, so feel free to follow along my journey and learn with me!
